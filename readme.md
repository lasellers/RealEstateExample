# RealEstateExample

This is a simple CRUD Example in .NET C# using an Entity Framework Code-First DB.

The only interesting thing is it is my first .NET MVC C# app since I did a fairly cold start of learning C# two weeks ago.

Note: I could have added AJAX to the form handling but this was a test to learn  C#, .NET, MVC and EF, etc, not spend time writing Javascript. That's for another DOTNET project.

Posted as an example.
